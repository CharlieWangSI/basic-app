> What is a Node module?

A: A Node module is a set of functions to include in your application. You can consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

> What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A: You may use either module.exports or  exports within your Node app. If you want your module to be a specific object type, use module.exports. Otherwise, use exports. Using exports is recommended unless you are planning on having your module be a specific object type.

> Why is using exports recommended?

A: exports is a reference to module.exports. Exports are used if module can be any object type, and module.exports are used if module needs to be a specific object type. Using an assignment operation to overwrite module.exports will throw errors.
